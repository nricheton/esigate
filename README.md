[![Build Status: Linux](https://travis-ci.org/esigate/esigate.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/esigate/esigate)

# Features
**Server-side integration** : Esigate allows a fast and invisible mashup of any web applications.
It can be used to add application modules, written in any programming language (PHP, Java, .Net...) to a CMS, without cache or accessibility issues.

**Shared remote templates** : Use a single, shared template for several applications, ensuring exactly the same design and real-time synchronization. Use a CMS or a portal as a template, to get graphical administration features for all your applications.


**Web accelerator** : Improved ESI tags to allow block-level caching of content for dynamic pages. Deliver dynamic, logged-in content in milli-seconds. Also deliver fully cached content.

# Usage test

esigate can be used : 
* as a standalone server
* deployed in a java application server (Tomcat, JBoss)
* embedded in a java application (Servlet filter or direct API usage)
